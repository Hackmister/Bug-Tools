# Zip Brute

Zip Brute is a pretty nice zipped file brute forcer tool. This works with some different types of zip files, and can come in handy doing certain CTFs. In the real world of bug hunting and pentesting, you probably won't need this, but it was a fun build and helped me learn, so it was worth it.
use: python ZipBrute.py -z <zip file> -p <password list>

# SSH Brute

use: python SSHBrute.py [-H target] [-p port] [-U userslist] [-P wordlist] [-T threads] [-w timeout] [-v]
