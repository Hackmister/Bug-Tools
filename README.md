# Bug-Tools

This repository hosts the code to some of my personally made tools, and some not-so-common tools I use for CTFs, bug hunting, and future pentesting. Not all of these are done. Down below in the ***Bugs*** category will let you know of anything weird going on with the tools. If I may not have noticed something, feel free to open an issue on it and I will work on fixing it.
# Bugs

Currently, SSHBrute.py does not go through entire lists. I had a > 1000 word list that it didn't make it to the end of. I will work to fix this and make a push once fixed.

# Credits
I have to give credit where it's due. Assetfinder is not my tool, and is originally hosted here: https://github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder
