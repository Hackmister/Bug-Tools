# Bug-Tools

This repo consist of my personal Bug Hunting tools. The only one I DID NOT MAKE is assetfinder. I take no credit for that tool. These tools will not all be my first choice. I do not suggest any "hacking" of any system you do not own or have prior permission from the owner.

# Bugs

Currently, SSHBrute.py does not go through entire lists. I had a > 1000 word list that it didn't make it to the end of. I will work to fix this and make a push once fixed.
