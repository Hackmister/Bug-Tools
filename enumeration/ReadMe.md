# Asset Finder
Asset Finder is a nice tool made by tomnomnom, not by myself. The reason I put it here is that this is actually a tool that I prefer when it comes to subdomain fuzzing. To use it for subdomain fuzzing, look below.

**use: ./assetfinder url --subs-only**

# Port Scanner
This is a very simple python portscanner, and is no doubt slower, and louder, than nmap. Also, this should be pretty obvious, but it doesn't have all the amazing options nmap has. "What does it do?" you may be asking. Well, it scans ports. It shows you what ports are open, and doesn't show you closed ports. Like I said, pretty simple.

**use: python3 portscanner.py**
